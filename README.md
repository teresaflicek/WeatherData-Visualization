# Background

### This website consists of 7 pages total, including:

### A landing page containing:

* An explanation of the project.
* Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### Four visualization pages, each with:

* A descriptive title and heading tag.
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
* A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

### A "Comparisons" page that:

* Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

### A "Data" page that:

* Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
* The table is a bootstrap table component.
